# PyTorch-Challenge
PyTorch Challenge - Image Classification - Classify flowers using CNN

The flower data for training is provided in challenge. Trained a model using pre-trained VGG network. The goal is to test this classifier 
with multiple pre-trained networks like VGG, RESNET, Inception etc and also to use own pool of convolution/pooling layers. Pick the one that
gives better acuuracy on validation data.

This script also has prediction and processing image from path to test this with different unseen flower images. The plot at the depicts
top 5 predictions along with their probablity score.
